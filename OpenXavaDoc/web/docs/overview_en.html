 OpenXava is a framework to develop JavaEE/J2EE applications quickly and easily.<br />
<br />
The underlying philosophy is to define with Java annotations or XML and to program with Java; the more definition and less programming the better.<br />
<br />
The main goal is to build the most typical things in a business application easily, while still having the necessary flexibility to develop more advanced features as you require.<br />
<br />
Below you can see some of the basic concepts of OpenXava.<br />
<h2 id="toc2"><a name="Overview-Business component"></a>Business component</h2>
 Business components are the fundamental pieces to create applications in OpenXava. In the OpenXava context, a business component is a Java class (although there also exists an XML version) that contains all the information about a business concept that you require to create applications. For example, all the information that the system needs to know about the concept of <em>invoice</em> is defined in the file <em>Invoice.java</em>.<br />
<br />
In a business component you can define:<br />
<ul><li>The data structure.</li><li>Validations, calculations and all logic associated with the business concept in general.</li><li>The possible views of the component, i. e. the configuration of all possible user interfaces.</li><li>The possibilities for the tabular data presentation. This is used in list mode (data navigation), reports, export to excel, etc.</li><li>Object-relational mapping. This includes information about database tables and how to convert them to the objects of your Java application.</li></ul><br />
This way of splitting is good for working in groups, and allows you to develop generic business components for reuse in different projects.<br />
<h2 id="toc3"><a name="Overview-Controllers"></a>Controllers</h2>
 A controller is a set of actions. An action is a button or link that a user can click on.<br />
<br />
The controllers define the things that user can do with the business component in the application.These are specified in the file <em>xava/controllers.xml</em> of your project. In addition OpenXava has a set of predefined controllers in <em>OpenXava/xava/default-controllers.xml</em>.<br />
<br />
The controllers are separated from the business components because one controller can be assigned to several business components. For example, a controller to make CRUD operations, to print in PDF format or to export to plain files, etc. can be used and reused for components like invoices, customers, suppliers, etc.<br />
<h2 id="toc4"><a name="Overview-Application"></a>Application</h2>
 An OpenXava application is a set of modules. A module joins a business component with one or more controllers.<br />
<br />
Each module of the application is what the end user uses, and generally it is configured as a portlet within a portal.<br />
<h2 id="toc5"><a name="Overview-Project structure"></a>Project structure</h2>
 A typical OpenXava project contains these folders:<br />
<ul><li><strong>[root]:</strong> In the root you can find <em>build.xml</em> (with the Ant task).</li><li><strong>src[source folder]:</strong> Contains your Java source code.</li><li><strong>xava:</strong> XML files to configure your OpenXava application. The main ones are <em>application.xml</em> and <em>controllers.xml</em>.</li><li><strong>i18n:</strong> Resource files with labels and messages in several languages.</li><li><strong>properties[source folder]:</strong> Property files to configure your application.</li><li><strong>data:</strong> Useful to hold the scripts to create the tables of your application, if needed.</li><li><strong>web:</strong> Web content. Usually JSP files, lib and classes. Most of the content is generated automatically, but you can put your own JSPs or other custom web resources here.</li></ul>
