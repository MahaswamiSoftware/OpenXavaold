The automated tests in this project do not include pretty layout of UI. 
Therefore, when you touch the layout code (a.k.a. JSPs) you have to test it visually
at least the next cases:
- InvoiceCustomerNoFrame: The properties before frames must be well aligned and on left.
- Product4NoDescriptionsLists: Fields inside frames must be nicely aligned by column.
- CustomerSellerAsDescriptionsListShowingReferenceViewNoFrameInSection: Members in section should have a nice layout.
