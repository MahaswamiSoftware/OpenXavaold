The automated tests in this project do not include CSS style. 
Therefore, when you touch the CSSsyou have to test it visually
with Terra and Light theme at least the next cases:
- Invoice: Go to first detail. 
	- Checkbox of paid must be well aligned.
	- Action links in name of customer and street of address must be well aligned.
	- The editors for street (with regular label) and postal code (with small label) must be well aligned.
		(Here we tolerate the street label slightly to up)
	- The editors for city (no label) and state (small label) must be well aligned.
	- The label of photo must be well aligned (top or middle but not ugly).
