 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"${warehouse.number} = ${this.warehouse.number} AND " +

 * </pre>
 * If you have this collection within Carrier, you can obtain with this collection 
 * all carriers of the same warehouse but not himself, that is the list of his 
 * fellow workers. As you see you can use this in the condition in order to 
 * reference the value of a property of current object.
