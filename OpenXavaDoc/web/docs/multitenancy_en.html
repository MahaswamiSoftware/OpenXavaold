      <h1 id="toc0"><a name="Multitenancy"></a>Multitenancy</h1>
      Multitenancy allows you to deploy an application once and this single
      application can serve several companies at the same time, where each
      company has access only to its own data. This is perfect for SaaS
      (Software as a Service), so you can deploy your application in the cloud
      and rent it to many customers. Also it's very useful for creating
      multimunicipality applications for public administration. Even if you're
      not interested in multicompany applications having several isolated
      datasets allows you do interesting things, such as having a production and
      testing databases without effort.<br>
      <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.openxava.org/xavapro" rel="nofollow">XavaPro</a>
      supports multitenancy out-of-the-box.<br>
      <h2 id="toc1"><a name="Multitenancy-Creating a new organization"></a>Creating
        a new organization</h2>
      To support multitenancy XavaPro uses organizations. You will find the
      Organizations module in the Admin folder. This module allows you to create
      a new organization just specifying its name and clicking a button:<br>
      <img src="files/multitenancy_en010.png" alt="multitenancy_en010.png" title="multitenancy_en010.png"><br>
      After clicking on the button "Create new organization", the new
      organization is ready to be used in the specified URL. The creation
      process creates a new schema in the database, creates all the application
      tables and populates the admin tables. Since v6.1 folders, roles and
      rights for the new organization are copied from root organization.<br>
      You can go to the company URL (/YourAplication/o/YourCompany) directly or
      to the application URL (/YourApplication). In the later case the sign in
      form will ask you for the company with a combo:<br>
      <img src="files/multitenancy_en030.png" alt="multitenancy_en030.png" title="multitenancy_en030.png"><br>
      Each organization has its own users, passwords, roles and rights, of
      course.<br>
      <h2 id="toc2"><a name="Multitenancy-Customization"></a>Customization</h2>
      The syntax for creating and removing schemas depends on your database.
      Your can specify the syntax for your database with the <em>createSchema</em>
      and <em>dropSchema</em> <em>(new in v5.7.1)</em> properties en <em>naviox.properties</em>:<br>

      If you want to make additional customization, like populating the
      application tables, creating some initial roles and users, giving a
      specific modules and folders structure, etc. you can define your own
      action to create the organization. The original action is defined in <em>Addons/xava/controllers.xml</em>
      in this way:<br>

      Just define your own class for <em>Organization.createNewOrganization</em>.<br>
      You can hide the combo with the list of organizations on sign in adding

      Any JPA or Hibernate code (Hibernate since v5.6) from your actions,
      calculators, entities, etc. goes against the correct schema for the
      current organization, however that is not the case for JDBC. If you want
      that your JDBC code goes against the schema of the current organization
      you have to add the next entry in <em>xava.properties</em>:<br>

      This works for databases where catalog and schema are synonymous, such as
      MySQL.<br>
      <h2 id="toc4"><a name="Multitenancy-Shared users between organizations (new in v5.6)"></a>Shared
        users between organizations <em>(new in v5.6)</em></h2>
      When you use multitenancy with XavaPro each organization has its own group
      of users totally independent from other organizations. This is OK for many
      cases, however some applications need to have the same group of users for
      all the organizations. You can configure your application to work in this
      way, just check the corresponding option in the configuration module:<br>
      <img src="files/multitenancy_en040.png" alt="multitenancy_en040.png" title="multitenancy_en040.png"><br>
      With "Shared users" activated the users and passwords for all the
      organizations are those of the root application. You have to create the
      users in the root application only and when one of these users try to
      access to an organization he has the option to join:<br>
      <img src="files/multitenancy_en050.png" alt="multitenancy_en050.png" title="multitenancy_en050.png"><br>
      There is a <em>joined</em> role in each organization to define the rights
      for these users.<br>
      When the user sign in with "Shared user" activated, the list of his
      organizations are shown in order to choose:<br>
      <img src="files/multitenancy_en060.png" alt="multitenancy_en060.png" title="multitenancy_en060.png"><br>
      The user can go to any of his organizations without login again. </div>
