Perhaps, we need a different security configuration in each action of controllers.xml. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nWe can add some based role access to controllers.xml with the virtue of override the declared in by annotations in action class.","replies":[{"user":"depourtales","created":"2008-07-07T12:41:47-07:00","body":"You are right. My first early draft was to include the access restrictions in controllers.xml. But I wanted to try to work only with annotations.  The problem that I sqw is that there will be two ways of defining accesses (one as annotations for entities and views and the other in XML for actions). This may lead to some confusion and inconsistencies.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBut for now, it may be OK and I will include the controllers in the draft."},{"user":"javierpaniza","created":"2008-07-08T08:01:57-07:00","body":"<em>The problem that I sqw is that there will be two ways of defining accesses<\/em><br \/>\nYes. But action class has not an one to one relation to the controllers.xml actions. The real OX actions are in controllers.xml actions, and the classes are the implementations.
