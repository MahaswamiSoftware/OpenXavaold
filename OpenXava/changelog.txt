- Added explicit support for identity (auto-increment) database columns by means of the new IdentityCalculator.
- IPropertyAction added, to allow inject property name and view to an action defined in an <property-view/>
- SearchByViewKeyAction has new protected methods for refining its behaviour easily.
- list.jsp admit the parameter singleSelection to indicate if the list has to use chechbox or radio button.
- CreateNewFromReferenceAction and SaveNewAction now have a property 'referenceSubview' (of View type) that has to be injected in controllers.xml. If you have some custom action that extends them remember modify your controllers.xml
- The order of elements in entity/aggregate are more flexible.
- Converters (defined in converters.xml or MyComponent.xml) are applied for not generated code too. In this case conversion is only used for list mode, and the programmer is responsible to include the conversion in get/set code.
- Some adaptation a oracle syntax: Inner joins for tab works fine with Oracle (" as " dropped).
 OpenXava is refined in order to avoid this jetspeed flaw
- All text editors are limited to 100 displayed charecters as maximum. You can customize it for you applicaction using maxSizeForTextEditor in xava.properties.
- The textEditor.jsp editor has a new parameter 'maxSize' that is assigned to the 'size' attribute of html <input /> element. You can use it in your own steroetypes.
- workspace.dir in openxava.properties (or equivalent) is ignore by OpenXava. Therefore, from now on you can rename the folder of your workspace without worrying about to change your openxava.properties.
- Key with 0 as value works in searching
- The ERROR messages on deleting the last object are not shown if removal is done correctly.
- xava-junit.properties support the 'application' property to indicate the default value for
	the application to all the junit test the project.
- Image editor does not show the broken image when there is no image.
- Labels.get and Labels.exists methods do not fail, instead returns a default value.
- XavaResource.getString never fails. This is for avoid some bug in jetspeed2 request implementations.
- Fix: descriptions-list with order and without condition fails
- Fix: collections of references to entities are full editable inside sections.
- Fix: Sterotype IMAGES_GALLERY crash when the property is not in i18n files.
- Fix: request.getLocale() throws NullPointerException in some circumstance inside Jetspeed2.
- Fix: actions which description contains ' fails
- Fix: Numeric text fields are aligned to right (maybe it was broken in some point)
- Fix: Bug in CollectionBaseAction.getObjects()
- Fix: collection of aggregates inside group inside section fails
- Fix: Searching in detail fails with boolean and properties with converters
- Fix: Searching in detail fails when more than one match to the searching
